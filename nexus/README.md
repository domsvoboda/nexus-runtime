# Nexus runtime build

This is an independent, unofficial integration of Proton Experimental, Wine and
the C++ XGameRuntime. It is not an official Valve or Xodus distribution.

Source dependencies are exact recursive Git submodules. The SDK, supplementary
libraries and the shader patch are pinned in `inputs.lock.json`. Keep the
submodules at their recorded revisions.

Run source checks with Node.js 22 or newer:

```sh
node nexus/check-source.mjs
node --test nexus/*.test.mjs nexus/tests/*.test.mjs nexus/runtime-compat/*.test.mjs
```

Source tests require CMake, GNU Make, rsync, GCC and both MinGW architectures.
The complete build additionally requires the pinned Proton SDK and Docker or
rootless Podman. Auxiliary native libraries must target glibc 2.35 or older.

From a clean `main` checkout with all recursive submodules initialized:

```sh
node nexus/build-auxiliary.mjs --work /absolute/new-auxiliary-directory
node nexus/build-runtime.mjs /absolute/auxiliary-directory /absolute/new-work-directory /absolute/new-output-directory
```

Set `NEXUS_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` for rootless Podman and
`NEXUS_BUILD_JOBS=16` to select a bounded worker count. Add `--resume` to the
same build command only when resuming its exact existing SDK configuration.
Work and output directories must be isolated from games and installed runtimes.

Build output is an unvalidated Experimental candidate, not an installation or
release. Native tests and game validation are separate. Keep corresponding
sources and all applicable licenses with any redistributed binaries.
